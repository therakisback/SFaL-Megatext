# SFaL-Megatext
Project for Sci-Fi as literature class.

Made in Unity Game Engine by Ryan Koenig (therakisback)

Current Version: Beta 1.0

Notes: 
* Currently just a movement demo. 
* The game is intended to be a platformer / metroidvania. It is heavily inspired by Hollow Knight and currently the movement systems are very similar.
* The current idea is to make a science fiction metroidvania, but without violence or main protagonists. As this will likely just end up being on the scale of a lot of game          jam submissions, I didn't care to make a story. The premise is to play a character who has landed on a new world. You behave as a visitor, killing nothing, and only                improving in the ways the player sees fit.
